spectre  beknazar, you should take a look at the coverage stuff too
1:12:02 AM	spectre  http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Kazakh_and_Karakalpak/Work_plan_%28GSOC_2014%29#Karakalpak_transducer
1:12:12 AM	spectre  so the aim for the karakalpak transducer is to have 80% coverage by the midterm
1:12:25 AM	spectre  are you able to calculate the coverage on your computer ?
1:14:31 AM	beknazar  how can i do that?
1:14:56 AM	spectre  first download the dump of the karakalpak wiki
1:15:16 AM	spectre  http://dumps.wikimedia.org/kaawiki/20140607/kaawiki-20140607-pages-articles.xml.bz2
1:15:19 AM	spectre  then type:
1:15:58 AM	spectre  wget https://svn.code.sf.net/p/apertium/svn/trunk/apertium-tools/WikiExtractor.py
1:15:59 AM	spectre  then:
1:16:20 AM	spectre  python3 WikiExtractor.py --infn kaawiki-20140607-pages-articles.xml.bz2
1:16:34 AM	spectre  then you should have a file called "wiki.txt" or something like that
1:17:16 AM	spectre  with that file you can do:
1:17:47 AM	spectre  cat wiki.txt | apertium -d /path/to/apertium-kaa kaa-morph | sed 's/$\W*\^/$\n^/g' | wc -l                         <-- total number of words
1:17:53 AM	firespeaker  beknazar: jaqsÄ± bar onda, ko'riskenshe
1:17:54 AM	spectre  cat wiki.txt | apertium -d /path/to/apertium-kaa kaa-morph | sed 's/$\W*\^/$\n^/g' | grep -v '\*' | wc -l                         <-- total number of known words
1:17:55 AM	spectre
1:18:09 AM	spectre  then calculate total known words / total number of words
1:18:10 AM	spectre
1:18:14 AM	spectre  then you get the coverage
1:18:33 AM	firespeaker  beknazar: I suggest writing a script to do it :)
1:19:13 AM	beknazar  :) ok, firespeaker
1:20:06 AM	spectre  you can make al ist like this
1:20:06 AM	spectre  http://pad.spline.de/kS3pAxsIhx
spectre  beknazar, so the idea is to take some words from the frequency list --- the highest frequency ones
1:25:15 AM	spectre  and categorise them
1:25:26 AM	spectre  in one step you just go through the list and add the category to all of them

-------------

spectie  beknazar, one thing we can do
3:19:11 AM	spectie  is try adding proper names too
3:19:19 AM	spectie  there are ~4000 proper names in kazakh transducer
3:19:32 AM	beknazar  yup, i will copy as many as i can then
3:19:41 AM	spectie  beknazar, i would suggest:
3:19:49 AM	spectie  take list from kazakh
3:19:54 AM	spectie  transliterate to karakalpak
3:20:05 AM	spectie  then try looking them up in the corpus
3:20:15 AM	spectie  and add the ones that you find in the corpus
